# Configs {#configs}

**Configs** are ready-to-use collections of rule groups combined with extensions.
They give you a complete setup out of the box for different environments like **Base**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **Node**.
Each config has variants like **recommended**, **typescript**, and **all**, so you can pick exactly what fits your project.
